## ðŸ§° Technical Structure
Each assignment includes a folder named "tests_file" containing 20 test files:

    10 arqXX.in files with test inputs

    10 arqXX.out files with expected outputs for those inputs

A checker.py script is provided in each folder to test the assignments, requiring a Linux terminal environment for execution.
