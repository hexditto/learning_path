# Sets in python
# Taught in mathematics
# Represented by Venn Diagram
# Sets are multables, although they accept only
# immutable as inner values

# Creating a set
# set(iterable) ou {1, 2, 3}
# s1 = set('Luiz')
s1 = {'Luiz', 1, 2, 3}
print(s1, type(s1))

# Sets are efficient to remove duplicate values of
# iterables.
# - they dont have indeces;
# - they are iterables (for, in, not in)

# Handful methods:
# add, update, clear, discard
